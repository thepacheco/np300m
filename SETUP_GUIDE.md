## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Application Error" on Render

**Check Logs:**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for errors

**Common Issues:**
- Missing dependency ‚Üí Add to `requirements.txt`
- Python version ‚Üí Render uses Python 3.7+ by default
- Port binding ‚Üí Code uses correct `app.run(host='0.0.0.0')`

### App is Slow

**Free Tier Limitations:**
- Sleeps after 15 min inactivity
- First request takes 30-60 sec to wake
- **Solution**: Upgrade to paid tier ($7/mo) for always-on

### Can't Connect to GitHub

1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí GitHub connection
3. Reconnect your account
4. Give Render access to your repository

### Analysis Times Out

**Too many stocks:**
1. Open settings
2. Disable some sectors
3. Reduce "Top Opportunities" to 10
4. Save settings

### Wrong Data

**Yahoo Finance issues:**
- Sometimes data is delayed
- Try running UPDATE again
- Check specific stock on yahoo.com

---

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Render Status
- Dashboard shows uptime
- Logs show any errors
- Free tier gets 750 hours/month (enough for daily use)

### Update Dependencies
If packages get outdated:
1. Edit `requirements.txt` on GitHub
2. Update version numbers
3. Commit changes
4. Render will rebuild

### Backup Your Config
Download `trading_config.json` occasionally:
1. Can't access directly on Render
2. But your settings persist between deploys
3. To reset: delete file via code update

---

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Bookmark the URL** - Don't lose it!
2. **Test with Paper Money** - Before real trades
3. **Run Analysis Daily** - Before market open
4. **Check Multiple Timeframes** - Don't just look at "today"
5. **Verify News** - Sentiment analysis is simple, double-check
6. **Start Small** - Don't use full capital at once
7. **Track Results** - See what scores actually work
