## ⚙️ Technical Details

### **How It Works:**

**Frontend (JavaScript):**
1. User clicks ANALYZE
2. JS shows log viewer
3. Adds initial log messages
4. Polls `/api/analysis-progress` every 2 seconds
5. Displays new messages as they arrive
6. Stops polling when complete

**Backend (Python):**
1. Analysis starts
2. Calls `log_progress(message, type)`
3. Updates global `analysis_progress` variable
4. Frontend polls and retrieves updates
5. Also prints to terminal (for Render logs)

**Communication:**
```
Frontend                    Backend
   |                           |
   |------ Click ANALYZE ----->|
   |                           | Start analysis
   |<----- Initial logs -------|
   |                           |
   |--- Poll progress (2s) --->|
   |<---- "10 stocks..." ------|
   |                           |
   |--- Poll progress (2s) --->|
   |<---- "20 stocks..." ------|
   |                           |
   |--- Poll progress (2s) --->|
   |<---- "Complete!" ---------|
   |                           |
   Stop polling                End
```

### **Polling Interval:**
- 2 seconds (default)
- Balances freshness vs. server load
- Adjustable if needed

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  "message": "✓ Progress: 20/150 stocks analyzed",
  "type": "info"  // or "success", "warning", "error"
}
```

---

## 🎨 Styling

### **Terminal-Like Design:**
- Dark background (#1e293b)
- Monospace font (Monaco, Menlo, Courier)
- Syntax-highlighted colors
- Auto-scroll
- Professional appearance

### **Responsive:**
- Works on iPad
- Works on desktop
- Scrollable on small screens
- Doesn't break layout

---

## 🔧 Customization Options

### **Want Different Colors?**

Edit CSS in `app.py`:
```css
.log-line.info { color: #60a5fa; }    /* Blue */
.log-line.success { color: #34d399; } /* Green */
.log-line.warning { color: #fbbf24; } /* Yellow */
.log-line.error { color: #f87171; }   /* Red */
```

### **Want More History?**

Change line limit in JavaScript:
```javascript
// Keep only last 100 lines
if (logContent.children.length > 100) {
  // Change 100 to 200 for more history
}
```

### **Want Faster Updates?**

Change polling interval:
```javascript
// Poll every 2 seconds
logPollingInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  // Change 2000 to 1000 for 1-second updates
}, 2000);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Logs Not Updating:**
- Check if log viewer is visible (toggle button)
- Open browser console (F12) for JS errors
- Check network tab for `/api/analysis-progress` calls

### **Too Much Scrolling:**
- Logs auto-scroll to bottom
- Manually scroll up to see history
- Or reduce line limit in code

### **Performance Issues:**
- Hide log viewer when not needed
- Reduce polling frequency
- Decrease history limit
