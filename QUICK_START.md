## 📱 Using the App

### The 3 Buttons:

**1. UPDATE (🔄)**
- Refreshes configuration
- Quick setup check
- Click first when you open the app

**2. ANALYZE (🔍)**  
- **THIS IS THE MAIN ONE**
- Scans all stocks
- Runs predictions
- Takes 2-5 minutes
- Click once per day (morning before market)

**3. RESULTS (📈)**
- Shows your opportunities
- Ranked by score (highest = best)
- See price targets
- Get buy/sell recommendations

### Settings to Adjust:

- **Capital**: Your money ($2,400 default)
- **Position Size**: % per trade (10% = $240 per stock)
- **Stop Loss**: When to cut losses (5% default)
- **Take Profit**: When to take profits (10% default)
- **Sectors**: Turn on/off sectors you want

## 💡 Reading Results

### What the Score Means:
- **80-100**: 🔥 Excellent opportunity
- **70-79**: ⭐ Very good
- **60-69**: ✅ Good
- **50-59**: 😐 Okay
- **<50**: ❌ Skip it

### What Action Means:

- **SELL**: Overbought or bearish
- **HOLD**: Wait for clearer setup

### Price Targets:
- **Today High**: Intraday target
- **Tomorrow**: Next day prediction
- **1 Week**: Swing trade target

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **This is NOT a day trading tool**
   - IRA has strict rules
   - Use for 3-7 day holds (swing trading)
   - Avoid 4+ trades in 5 days

2. **No guarantees**
   - Markets are unpredictable
   - Past performance ≠ future results
   - You can lose money

3. **Start small**
   - Test with paper money first
   - Don't use all $2,400 at once
   - Diversify across multiple stocks

4. **Do your homework**
   - Verify the news
   - Check company financials
   - Don't blindly follow recommendations

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Analysis is slow
- Disable some sectors in settings
- Reduce number of opportunities
- Yahoo Finance sometimes slow

### Can't access from iPad
